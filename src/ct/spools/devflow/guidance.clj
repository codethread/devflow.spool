(ns ct.spools.devflow.guidance
  "Loader for the devflow authoring knowledge base.

  The knowledge itself lives as markdown under
  `resources/ct/spools/devflow/guidance/`: one cohesive document per artifact
  guide, the workspace overview, and the document templates. This namespace
  slurps those files and expands the placeholders that keep shared rules
  stated once:

  - `{{template:<file>}}`        — `templates/<file>`, fenced into the guide
  - `{{config-id:<PREFIX>}}`     — the configuration-identification paragraph,
                                   rendered for one document prefix
  - `{{id-editing}}`             — the shared ID-editing rule
  - `{{ownership-table:k1,k2}}`  — document-ownership rows for the named kinds

  Files are read on every call, so an edit under resources/ shows up on the
  next fetch without a weaver restart. Workflow steps advertise the guide for
  their artifact through the `devflow/guide` strand attribute; agents fetch a
  guide with `ct.spools.devflow/guidance` or `strand devflow guidance <key>`."
