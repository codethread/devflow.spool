  "Clojure-native workflow definitions for the devflow lifecycle.

  Every stage is a static `defworkflow` Var: a definition a worker can read
  through `strand workflow show <name>` before starting a run, with its param
  contract owned by a spec rather than by a constructor's argument list
  (PROP-Wcd-001.S12). The definitions are ordinary workflow data that callers
  can inspect, compose, pour as molecules, or materialize as wisps.

  Authoring knowledge for the artifacts each stage produces (proposal, specs,
  plan, task queue, ...) lives in `ct.spools.devflow.guidance` and is served
  by `guidance` from Clojure and by the `devflow` op (`strand devflow
  guidance`) for CLI workers; artifact-authoring steps advertise the matching
  guide key via the `devflow/guide` attribute."
